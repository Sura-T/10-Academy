# üåû MoonLight Energy Solutions: Solar Radiation Insights Dashboard

## üìã **Project Overview**

Welcome to the **MoonLight Energy Solutions Solar Radiation Insights Dashboard**! This dashboard is designed to help visualize key insights related to solar radiation, wind speed, temperature, and other environmental factors to support decision-making for solar investments.

The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze solar radiation measurement data across regions (Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo).
- Identify key trends, patterns, and outliers using statistical analysis and visualization.
- Visualize the relationship between wind conditions, temperature, and solar radiation using **Streamlit**.

## üèÜ **Features**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize trends in **Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI)**, **Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI)**, and **Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI)** over time.
   - Perform **outliers detection** to identify anomalies in the GHI data.
   - Understand correlations among environmental variables like GHI, wind speed, humidity, and temperature.

2. **Interactive Streamlit Dashboard**:
   - A user-friendly, interactive dashboard with visualizations to explore data insights dynamically.
   - Features include:
     - Correlation heatmaps.
     - Time-series analysis.
     - Wind and solar speed analysis.
     - Outliers detection visualization.
